# Angular2-Notifications
A light and easy to use notifications library for Angular 2. 

## Example
Take a look at the live demo here: [Live Demo](http://flauc.github.io/angular2-notifications)
You can also clone this repository and check out the example folder.

## Setup
Download the library with npm
```
npm install --save angular2-notifications
```

Map the library in your System.config if you're using SystemJs.
```js
System.config({
    map: {
        'notifications': 'node_modules/angular2-notifications'
    }
});
```

Add the SimpleNotificationsComponent in to the component where you want to use the notifications.
```js
...
directives: [SimpleNotificationsComponent],
template: '<simple-notifications [options]="options"></simple-notifications>'
...
```

The onCreate and onDestroy Event Emitters emit the notification that was created or destroyed you can utilise this functionality like this:
```js
<simple-notifications [options]="options" (onCreate)="created($event)" (onDestroy)="destroyed($event)"></simple-notifications>
```

You will also need to use the NotificationsService in your component to create or remove the notifications.
```js
...
providers: [NotificationsService]
...
constructor( private _service: NotificationsService ) {}
...
```
This are the currently available access methods:
* `success(title: string, content: string, override?: any)` - Creates a success notification with the provided title and content.
* `error(title: string, content: string, override?: any)` - Creates an error notification with the provided title and content.
* `alert(title: string, content: string, override?: any)` - Creates an alert notification with the provided title and content.
* `info(title: string, content: string, override?: any)` - Creates an info notification with the provided title and content.
* `create(title: string, content: string, type: string, override?: any)` - Use this method to create any notification type ['success', 'error', 'alert', 'info'].
* `html(html: any, type: string, override?: any` - Use this method to create a notification with custom html.
* `removeAll()` - Closes all currently open notifications.

## Options
This are the current options that can be pass to the component:

Option | Type | Default | Description | 
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
__timeOut__ | int | 0 | Determine how long a notification should wait before closing. If set to 0 a notification won't close it self.
__showProgressBar__ | boolean | true | Determine if a progress bar should be shown or not.
__pauseOnHover__ | boolean | true | Determines if the timeOut should be paused when the notification is hovered.
__lastOnBottom__ | boolean | true | Determines if new notifications should appear at the bottom or top of the list.
__clickToClose__ | boolean | true | Determines if notifications should close on click.
__maxLength__ | int | 0 | Set the maximum allowed length of the content string. If set to 0 or not defined there is no maximum length.
__maxStacks__ | int | 8 | Set the maximum number of notifications that can be on the screen at once.
__preventDuplicates__ | boolean | false | If true prevents duplicates of open notifications.
__preventLastDuplicates__ | boolean | false | If true prevents duplicates of the latest notification shown.
__theClass__ | string | null | A class that should be attached to the notification. (It doesn't exactly get attached to the selector but to the first div of the template.)

Here is an example of passing the options to the component. You only pass the options you want changed.

```js
...
template: '<simple-notifications [options]="options"></simple-notifications>'
...
public options = {
    timeOut: 5000,
    lastOnBottom: true
    ...
}
```

The following options can be overridden by passing them to the override object:
* timeOut
* showProgressBar
* pauseOnHover
* clickToClose 
* maxLength
* theClass
```js
this._notificationsService.success(
    title: 'example', 
    content:'example', 
    override: {
        timeOut: 5000,
        showProgressBar: true,
        pauseOnHover: false,
        clickToClose: false,
        maxLength: 10
    }
)
```
